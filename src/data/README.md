# Supplemental Data

This folder contains supplemental data used for updating and enhancing the original data parsed from the HTML files. The goal is to use the HTML files as a sort of "source of truth" and then apply transforms, additions and updates, via these files. Hopefully, at some point in the future a raw data set can be calculated and kept here.
